# Semi-Automatic Definition Phrasing for a Climate Change Discourse Glossary

Data and code for Anna-Janina Goeckes's 2022 Universit√§t Potsdam MSc thesis Semi-Automatic Definition Phrasing for a Climate Change Discourse Glossary" under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Manfred Stede and Prof. Dr. Birgit Schneider.

## General Information

### Contents
The structure of this repository is as follows:

- `implementation`: contains the R and Python code and outputs 
- `plots`: contains the plots used in the final thesis paper
- `thesis.pdf`: final thesis paper in pdf format

The sub directories `implementation/R` and `implementation/Python` contain further READMEs that detail the contents.

### Note
The implementation notebooks that can be found in `implementation/R/notebooks` and `implementation/Python/notebooks` are designed to provide a walkthrough of the complete implementation process to make the steps as transparent as possible. 

Throughout the implementation notebooks (and in the thesis paper when referring to variables and outputs of the notebooks) the notation of `pro` and `contra` is used to refer to the data from the climate research supporter's corpus (pro) and the climate research skeptic's corpus (con/contra). The terms are not used to indicate a rating of the subdiscourses.
